Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability.
The blog allows all posts by users to be shown more or less as it was received
(using the django template safe tag). The application does not manually protect
against HTML tags, which results in the users who can write posts to be able to
add <scipt> tags to their posts.
This flaw can be fixed by removing the safe tag from the view.html template.
Paragraph splits can be safely added by parsing the post text in the view -view
into a list of paragraphs, and using the template engine's for loop to iterate
over the list, inserting each paragraph into a <p> element.

FLAW 2:
https://github.com/gustafla/cyberblog/blob/master/blog/views.py#L41
Cross-site Request Forgery.
By marking the create_post view with the csrf_exempt decorator, Django does not
require a CSRF protection cookie. This enables a malicious site to trick the
user into writing a blog post on the cyberblog site.
Here's an example of what an exploit page could look like:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CONGRATULATIONS!</title>
    <!-- A READY TO RUN VERSION OF THIS IS PROVIDED IN THE csrf_exploit DIRECTORY -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE WON $ 1,000,000</h1>
    <p>Just fill out the form below to claim your prize! Include your Full
    Name, Address, Phone Number, Social Security Number and Email Address.</p>
    <form method="GET" action="http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/create/">
      <input type="hidden" id="title" name="title" value="I GOT DOXED" /><br />
      <textarea id="text" name="text" style="height: 200px; width: 400px"></textarea><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Claim $1,000,000">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
This flaw can be fixed by removing the csrf_exempt decorator and adding a
csrf_token in the form in the post.html -template. Also, a good practice would
be to only accept new posts to be posted with the POST-method.

Weak Authentication.
The blog account registration requires passwords to be 8 or fewer alphanumeric
characters, and treats them as case-insensitive. This flaw makes the user
accounts vulnerable to brute force attacks and the passwords become especially
compromised if the database gets leaked. The registration and login pages don't
have protection against brute force attacks. Also users do not have a way to
change their passwords.
This can be fixed by changing password requirements to require longer
passwords, removing the .lower() calls which make the passwords
case-insensitive, checking the passwords against common password lists, and/or
by adding mandatory multi-factor authentication. The registration and login
pages can be protected against bots and brute force attacks by adding counters
and timeouts, and/or captchas. A page for changing account's passwords should
be implemented.

https://github.com/gustafla/cyberblog/blob/master/blog/views.py#L55
Misconfigured Security Headers.
Some pages, such as the registration and login should have the header
X-Frame-Options configured to disallow embedding on other sites. This could
potentially lead to user authentication information leaking to attackers, or
attackers tricking users to write unintended posts.
This can be fixed by removing all the xframe_options_exempt decorators.

FLAW 5:
https://github.com/gustafla/cyberblog/blob/master/accounts/views.py#L27
Broken Access Control.
All users who sign up using the register-form are created as superusers,
granting them rights to use the /admin pages. This violates the principle of
least privilege by default.
This can be fixed by creating regular users instead (User.objects.create_user)
and creating superusers manually by other superusers when deemed necessary.

FLAW 6:
Security Logging and Monitoring failure.
The application doesn't log any events at all. Especially security related
events such as login success and failure, user registration and new posts
should be logged in sufficient detail for auditing and the logs should ideally
be sent and stored at multiple different machines.

FLAW 7:
https://github.com/gustafla/cyberblog/blob/master/cyberblog/settings.py#L108
Cryptographic Failure.
The application is configured to store passwords as unsalted MD5 hashes. This
is almost as bad as storing the passwords in plaintext, as MD5 is very fast to
crack and the lack of salt enables use of rainbow tables as well.
This can be fixed by removing the PASSWORD_HASHERS setting from settings.py in
favor of Django's secure default settings for password hashing.
