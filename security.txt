Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability.
By allowing content posted by users (on the blog posts) to be shown as it was
received (using the django template safe tag), and not manually safeguarding
against HTML tags, the users who can write posts can add <scipt> tags to their
posts.
This flaw can be fixed by removing the safe tag from the view.html template.
Paragraph splits can be safely added by parsing the post text in the view -view
into a list of paragraphs, and using the template engine's for loop to iterate
over the list, inserting each paragraph into a <p> element.

FLAW 2:

Cross-site Request Forgery
By marking the create_post view with the csrf_exempt decorator, Django does not
require a CSRF protection cookie. This enables a malicious site to trick the
user into writing a blog post on the cyberblog site. An example attack page is
provided in the csrf_exploit directory in the repository.
This flaw can be fixed by removing the csrf_exempt decorator and adding a
csrf_token in the form in the post.html -template. Also, a good practice would
be to only accept new posts to be posted with the POST-method.
