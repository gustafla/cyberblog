# Cyber Security Base Project I

This is a very simple blog site with user login, logout, index and post
creation.

Not intended for production use.

Due to technical limitations (using GET requests to make CSRF possible), blog
posts cannot be very long at all, 1000 characters or so.

## Security Flaws

This application has multiple known security issues on purpose. See
[security.txt](security.txt)
